# Travel App Project

## Overview
This project is a custom travel application that integrates multiple APIs to provide users with travel information. The app is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and it leverages Webpack for module bundling, an Express server for backend operations, and service workers for offline functionality. The project emphasizes clean code, thorough testing, and efficient refactoring.

## Features
- **API Integration**: The app retrieves data from three different APIs, with one API relying on another to function.
- **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: The app dynamically updates the DOM based on user input and API responses.
- **Webpack Environment**: The project is set up in a Webpack environment to manage dependencies and optimize the build process.
- **Express Server**: A simple Express server is used to handle API requests and serve the application.
- **Service Workers**: Service workers are implemented to enable offline functionality and improve performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
